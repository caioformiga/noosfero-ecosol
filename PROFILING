Noosfero supports newrelic_rpm, fiveruns_tuneup and rails performance testing for profiling

To use newrelic_rpm and fiveruns_tuneup run the webserver using the 'profiling' environment:
$ script/server thin -e profiling

fiveruns_tuneup will show up in the top of every page.
newrelic_rpm reports are accessible at '/newrelic'

NOTE: newrelic_rpm is imcompatible with fiveruns_tuneup. Disable the latter to use the former.
(See config/environment.rb and config/environments/profiling.rb)

To run a performance test use:
$ script/performance/profiler test/performance/script.rb
